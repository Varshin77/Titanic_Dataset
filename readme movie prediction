# Movie Rating Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a **predictive model** to estimate movie ratings based on various attributes. The dataset used for this task is the **IMDb Movies India dataset**.

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains information about movies, including:
- **Year**: The release year of the movie.
- **Votes**: Number of audience votes.
- **Duration**: Length of the movie in minutes.
- **Genre**: The category of the movie (e.g., Action, Drama, Comedy).
- **Director**: The name of the movie director.
- **Actors**: The lead actors in the movie.
- **Rating**: The IMDb rating, which serves as the target variable for prediction.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing numerical values were replaced with their median, while categorical missing values were replaced with the mode.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: One-hot encoding was used to transform categorical features like Genre, Director, and Actors.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - **Director Success Rate**: Average rating of all movies directed by a particular director.
  - **Average Rating of Similar Movies**: Grouping by Genre to compute average ratings.

## Model Selection & Training
- **Algorithm Used**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Train-Test Split**: 80% training, 20% testing
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **R-squared Score (R²)**

## Results
The trained model predicts IMDb ratings with the following results:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared differences between actual and predicted values.
- **R² Score:** Evaluates the proportion of variance explained by the model.

## Visualizations
A scatter plot compares actual and predicted ratings, giving insight into model performance.

## How to Use
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn matplotlib`
2. Run the Python script to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

## Repository Structure
- `movie_rating_prediction.py`: The main script for data preprocessing and model training.
- `IMDb Movies India.csv`: The dataset used for training the model.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Future Improvements
- Experimenting with deep learning models like Neural Networks.
- Hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction accuracy.
- Incorporating additional features like budget and box office collections.
